# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
CS 250 Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves understanding what users are trying to achieve and turning those goals into clear, actionable features. Creating user stories helps by capturing these needs in a simple, structured way—usually in the format “As a user, I want [feature] so that [benefit].” This keeps the development team focused on the user’s perspective and ensures that features are meaningful and useful. User stories also support planning and collaboration by breaking work into manageable pieces with clear goals and acceptance criteria, making it easier to prioritize, develop, and test the right functionality.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I start by clearly understanding the problem, gathering user requirements, and breaking the work into smaller, manageable tasks. I focus on building in increments, testing early, and continuously improving based on feedback. In my future development work, I hope to incorporate key Agile processes like iterative development, where features are delivered in small cycles, and daily standups to keep communication clear and progress visible. I also want to use sprint planning and retrospectives to continuously reflect and adapt, and rely on user stories to ensure that every feature is built with the end-user in mind. These Agile practices will help me stay flexible, deliver value faster, and work more effectively in a team.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team’s goals while supporting collaboration, communication, and trust. It involves writing clean, maintainable code, meeting deadlines, and being open to feedback. A good team member listens actively, shares knowledge, helps others when needed, and respects diverse perspectives. They also communicate clearly, ask questions when uncertain, and adapt to changes—especially in Agile environments where flexibility and teamwork are key. Ultimately, it’s about putting the success of the project and the team above individual ego.
